## Project Overview
ðŸš§ This project is currently under active development.

The aim of this project is to provide users with real-time updates on the SL public transport system in Stockholm. By aggregating and presenting the latest deviations and disruptions, I strive to offer commuters accurate information to enhance their travel experience. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to develop and refine this service.
